## Installation

There are two "package.json" files, one for Angular2 app, one for Node.js backend.

2. Run `npm install` in the main directory (Node.js)

## Usage

Run two `npm start` scripts.
1. Run `npm start` in the *src* directory (this will listen for changes in the files)
2. Run `npm start` in the main directory (this will start webserver)
3. Go to `localhost:3000` for app
